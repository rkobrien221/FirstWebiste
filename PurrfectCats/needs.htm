	<h2>Pros of Indoor Cats</h2>
	
    <p>Safety is a major concern when deciding whether or not you want your cat outside. Cars, poisons, and other environmental hazards are just some of the many things that can endanger your cat while outside. Cats are also more clean while inside since they are not rolling around in dirt and mud.
   
	Requirements:</p>
    
	<ol>
		<li>Litter Box</li>
		<li>Cat Bed</li>
		<li>Scratching post</li>
		</ol>
	
	<h2>Cons of Indoor Cats</h2>
	
	<p>As with all things, having indoor cats can have negatives too.  Indoor cats will become bored once they have explored the entire house and will often have behavioural problems like scratching the couch, knocking stuff over, or using the bathroom outside of the litter box.  Lack of exercise and overeating could lead to obesity.  Escape is also a huge danger if your cat is not used to outside environments.</p>
	
	<h2>Pros of Outdoor Cats</h2>
	
	<p>Letting your cat outdoors during the day will provide your cat with much needed exercise.  Being outside all day will also allow them to use the bathroom outside, which means less clean up for you. Also they will be less energetic or destructive when they are hanging out inside.
	
	Requirements:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Regular cleaning</li>
		<li>Parasite medication</li>
		<li>Identification</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Cons of Outdoor Cats</h2>
	
	<p>When a cat goes outdoor it is entering into a whole new world of dangers. Outdoor cats are more susceptible to parasites like fleas and worms.  Outdoor cats should also have their front claws to protect themselves from other neighbourhood cats.</p>
