   <h1>Cat Overview</h1>
   <p>
   The domestic cat is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. They are often called housecats when kept as an indoor pet. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt pests.
   </p>
   <p>
   Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   Cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering and the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control. This has led to extinction of many bird species.
   </p>
   <p>Since cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007, concluded that domestic cats are descended from African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica), having diverged around 8,000 BC in West Asia. Cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where humans live.

   <h2>Facts About Cats</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>On average, cats spend 2/3 of every day sleeping. That means a nine-year-old cat has been awake for only three years of its life.</li>
      <li>Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.</li>
      <li>A group of cats is called a "clowder.""</li>
      <li>A cat can't climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat'"s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down.</li>
	  <li>During the time of the Spanish Inquisition, Pope Innocent VIII condemned cats as evil and thousands of cats were burned. Unfortunately, the widespread killing of cats led to an explosion of the rat population, which exacerbated the effects of the Black Death</li>
	  <li>During the Middle Ages, cats were associated with witchcraft, and on St. John's Day, people all over Europe would stuff them into sacks and toss the cats into bonfires. On holy days, people celebrated by tossing cats from church towers.</li>
	  <li>Cats are North America's most popular pets: there are 73 million cats compared to 63 million dogs. Over 30% of households in North America own a cat</li>
	  <li>The first cat in space was a French cat named Felicette (a.k.a. "Astrocat") In 1963, France blasted the cat into outer space. Electrodes implanted in her brains sent neurological signals back to Earth. She survived the trip</li>
	  <li>A cat rubs against people not only to be affectionate but also to mark out its territory with scent glands around its face. The tail area and paws also carry the cat's scent</li>
	  <li>Smuggling a cat out of ancient Egypt was punishable by death. Phoenician traders eventually succeeded in smuggling felines, which they sold to rich people in Athens and other important cities</li>
	  <li>The first commercially cloned pet was a cat named "Little Nicky." He cost his owner $50,000, making him one of the most expensive cats ever</li>
	  <li>Cats don't have sweat glands over their bodies like humans do. Instead, they sweat only through their paws</li>
	  <li>The richest cat is Blackie who was left around 22,937,358 dollars by his owner, Ben Rea</li>
	  <li>There are up to 60 million feral cats in the United States alone</li>
